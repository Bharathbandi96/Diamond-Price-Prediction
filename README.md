# Diamond-Price-Prediction
<h1><center>Diamond Price Prediction</center></h1>

Diamonds are the most valued for their rarity and also a significant investment. Predicting the price of a diamond is a challenging task influenced by various factors such as cut, clarity, color and much more. 

In this project, I have taken a sample dataset which provides various characteristics of a diamond which can be used in predicting the price. I have performed some priliminary analysis on these dataset and developed few machine learning models to predict the price of diamonds based on its characteristics.

I have also used k-fold cross validation and dimensionality reduction techniques which helps in increasing models performance and predicting the diamons price accuratily.
