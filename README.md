<h1><center>Diamond Price Prediction</center></h1>

Diamonds are the most valued for their rarity and also a significant investment. Predicting the price of a diamond is a challenging task influenced by various factors such as cut, clarity, color and much more. 

In this project, I have taken a sample dataset which provides various characteristics of a diamond which can be used in predicting the price. I have performed some priliminary analysis on these dataset and developed few machine learning models to predict the price of diamonds based on its characteristics.

I have also used k-fold cross validation and dimensionality reduction techniques which helps in increasing models performance and predicting the diamons price accuratily.

#### Dataset features </br>

Id - Diamond sample ID </br>
Carat -  Caret weight of the diamond </br>
Cut - Cut quality of the diamond </br>
Color - Color of the diamond with D being the best and J being the worst </br>
Clarity - Clarity of the diamond </br>
Depth - Â The height of a diamond, measured from the culet to the table, divided by its average girdle diameter </br>
Table - The width of the diamond's table expressed as a percentage of its average diameter </br>
X - Length of the diamond in mm </br>
Y - Width of the diamond in mm </br>
Z - Height of the diamond in mm </br>
Price - Price of the diamond </br>
